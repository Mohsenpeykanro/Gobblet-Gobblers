# Gobblet Gobblers

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Gobblet Gobblers game, developed as part of a university coursework project. The goal was to design and build a turn-based strategy game using object-oriented programming concepts and C++ fundamentals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

Gobblet Gobblers is a variation of Tic-Tac-Toe with added depth: players place or move pieces of different sizes on a 3x3 grid, where larger pieces can cover (or "gobble") smaller ones. This project aims to simulate this behavior with a clean command-line interface and well-structured object-oriented code.

The project serves as a practical example of:

- C++ class design
- Inheritance and encapsulation
- Data structure usage (e.g., stack-like behavior for cell layering)
- Turn-based game logic
- Console I/O and user interaction

## üéÆ Gameplay Summary

- Two players take turns placing or moving Gobblers.
- Each Gobbler has a size (small, medium, large).
- A larger Gobbler can cover a smaller one.
- The goal is to get three of your visible pieces in a row.

The game is played in the terminal and is entirely text-based.
